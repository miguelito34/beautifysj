## Summary Findings

* *All MySanJose Platforms*
	* No clear relationship between linguistic isolation and request frequency.
	* Younger areas seem to more (slightly) more fequently use MySanJose Platforms to make requests 	as compared to older areas.
	* The overwhelming majority of graffiti requests and streetlight outage requests are made using 	MySanJose platforms.
	* There is not a particularly strong relationship between education and MySanJose platform 	usage.
	* There may be a slight negative relationship between the proportion of owner occupied units and usage of MySanJose platforms.
	* There may be a slight positive relationship between the proportion of renter occupied units and usage of MySanJose platforms.
	* There do not seem to be any particularly striking relationships between race and usage of 	MySanJose platforms.
	* Small negative correlation between requests frequency and income among all requests, but not for individual requests.
	* No clear relationship between cellular connectivity and request frequency.
	* No clear relationship between broadband connectivity and request frequency.
* *MySanJose Mobile App*
	* Potentially negative relationship between age and frequency of mobile platform use.
	* Potentially negative relationship between education level and frequency of mobile platform use (i.e. blocks which tend to use the mobile platform more frequently also seem to be less college educated). 
	* Potentially negative relationship between home ownership and frequency of mobile platform use. Blocks in which more units are renter owned, appear to use the mobile platform more frequently.
	* Doesn't neccessarily hold true for graffiti requests made on the mobile platform.
	* Potentially positive relationship between the Hispanic population and mobile usage, and a potentially negative relationship between the Asian population and mobile usage.
	* Potential strong negative relationship between income and use of the mobile app.
	* Interestingly there doesn't seem to be much relation between cellular connectivity and use of the mobile platform.
	* Potential negative relatinship between broadband connectivity and mobile app usage.
	* Streetlight outages and Graffiti reports were reported via mobile by very few census block groups.
	* The majority of illegal dumping requests and graffiti reports were made via the mobile platform.
* *MySanJose Web Platform*
	* The web platform is mostly used for abandoned vehicle requests.
	* There appeard to be a slight negative relationship between linguistic isolation and use of the web platform (i.e. more isolated census blocks appear to use the web platform relatively less frequently).
	* Older census blocks appear to use the web platform more frequently than younger blocks.
	* More educated census blocks appear to use the web platform more frequently than less educated census blocks.
	* Potential slightly positive relationship between home ownership and increased web platform usage.
	* Potential positive relationship between White and Asian populations (negative for Hispanic) and web platform usage.
	* Potential positive relationship between income and web platform usage.
	* Potential slightly positive relationship between cellular connectivity and increased web platform usage.
	* Potential slightly positive relationship between broadband connectivity and increased web platform usage.

## MySanJose Mobile App

### Observations

* Potentially negative relationship between age and frequency of mobile platform use.
* Potentially negative relationship between education level and frequency of mobile platform use (i.e. blocks which tend to use the mobile platform more frequently also seem to be less college educated). 
* Potentially negative relationship between home ownership and frequency of mobile platform use. Blocks in which more units are renter owned, appear to use the mobile platform more frequently.
	* Doesn't neccessarily hold true for graffiti requests made on the mobile platform.
* Potentially positive relationship between the Hispanic population and mobile usage, and a potentially negative relationship between the Asian population and mobile usage.
* Potential strong negative relationship between income and use of the mobile app.
* Interestingly there doesn't seem to be much relation between cellular connectivity and use of the mobile platform.
* Potential negative relatinship between broadband connectivity and mobile app usage.
* Streetlight outages and Graffiti reports were reported via mobile by very few census block groups.
* The majority of illegal dumping requests and graffiti reports were made via the mobile platform.

## MySanJose Web Platforms

### Observations

* The web platform is mostly used for abandoned vehicle requests.
* There appeard to be a slight negative relationship between linguistic isolation and use of the web platform (i.e. more isolated census blocks appear to use the web platform relatively less frequently).
* Older census blocks appear to use the web platform more frequently than younger blocks.
* More educated census blocks appear to use the web platform more frequently than less educated census blocks.
* Potential slightly positive relationship between home ownership and increased web platform usage.
* Potential positive relationship between White and Asian populations (negative for Hispanic) and web platform usage.
* Potential positive relationship between income and web platform usage.
* Potential slightly positive relationship between cellular connectivity and increased web platform usage.
* Potential slightly positive relationship between broadband connectivity and increased web platform usage.
