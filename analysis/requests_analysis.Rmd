## Summary Findings

* MySanJose Mobile App
	* Home owners appear to use the mobile platform less frequently than renters
		* Doesn't neccessarily hold true for graffiti requests
	* Asian users seems to submit relatively fewer requests on the mobile platform
	* Wealthier areas appear to use the mobile platform less
	* Interestingly there doesn't seem to be much relation between cellular connectivity and use of the mobile platform
	* Areas with higher internet connectivity used the mobile platform relatively less
	* Streetlight outages and Graffiti reports were reported via mobile by very few census block groups 
	* The majority of illegal dumping requests and graffiti reports were made via the mobile platform
* MySanJose Web Platform
* All MySanJose Platforms

## MySanJose Mobile App

### Observations

* Home owners appear to use the mobile platform less frequently than renters
	* Doesn't neccessarily hold true for graffiti requests
* Asian users seems to submit relatively fewer requests on the mobile platform
* Wealthier areas appear to use the mobile platform less
* Interestingly there doesn't seem to be much relation between cellular connectivity and use of the mobile platform
* Areas with higher internet connectivity used the mobile platform relatively less
* Streetlight outages and Graffiti reports were reported via mobile by very few census block groups 
* The majority of illegal dumping requests and graffiti reports were made via the mobile platform
